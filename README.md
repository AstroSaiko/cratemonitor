Python files and rrds to monitor uTCA crates. In soaktest you will find a complete structure with all the files needed to 
set up a database and monitor the crates and its cards. In P5 you will find a script based on ipmitool that gets sensor data
from the crates. This is the script that is deployed as the backend for the Pixel Crate Monitor at P5.
